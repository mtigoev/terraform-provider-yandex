# yandex\_mdb\_opensearch\_cluster

Manages a OpenSearch cluster within the Yandex.Cloud. For more information, see
[the official documentation](https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/managed-opensearch/concepts).

## Example Usage

Example of creating a Single Node OpenSearch cluster.

```hcl
resource "yandex_mdb_opensearch_cluster" "foo" {
  name        = "test"
  environment = "PRESTABLE"
  network_id  = "${yandex_vpc_network.foo.id}"

  config {

    admin_password = "super-password"

    opensearch {
      node_groups {
          name = "group0"
          assign_public_ip     = true
          hosts_count          = 1
          subnet_ids           = ["${yandex_vpc_subnet.foo.id}"]
          zone_ids             = ["ru-central1-a"]
          roles                = ["data", "manager"]
          resources {
            resource_preset_id   = "s2.micro"
            disk_size            = 10737418240
            disk_type_id         = "network-ssd"
          }
      }
    }
  }

  maintenance_window {
    type = "ANYTIME"
  }
}

resource "yandex_vpc_network" "foo" {}

resource "yandex_vpc_subnet" "foo" {
  zone           = "ru-central1-a"
  network_id     = "${yandex_vpc_network.foo.id}"
  v4_cidr_blocks = ["10.5.0.0/24"]
}
```
